## **User Experience**
<br/>

### **Initial Discussion**

If like me, you’re someone has an interest in plants and plant-based gifts, the choices currently out there are limited to Etsy and a variety of usually very dated, clunky websites. Sleek, modern websites for the modern botanist are few and far between!

### **Colour Scheme**

Modern, clean and sleek are the basis for this e-commerce website. I have chosen to keep the product pages as clean as possible, therefore a minimalist design and colour palette were used. The main colours being used are black, white and an off-white.

<br/>

### **Typography**

Google Fonts was used to import the "Handlee" Font. This is used for all text throughout the website.

<br/>

---
<br/>

### **Database Schema**

The database schema shows the current models in the database. The datbase model is based on the model used in the Boutique Ado Walkthrough and remains relatively unchanged.

<br/>

## **Accessibility**

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Aria labels - providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text, such as footer icons.
* Ensuring there is adequate colour contrast throughout the site.

<br/>

## **Deployment and Local Development**

<br/>

### **Deployment**

This project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps:

<br/>

#### **ElephantSQL**

1. Navigate to ElephantSQL.com and create a user account, by using the log-in with GitHub option.
2. Click “Create New Instance”.
3. Set up your plan. (You can leave the 'tags' field blank.)
4. Select a region.
5. Select a data centre near you
6. Then click “Review”.
7. Check your details are correct and then click “Create instance”.
8. Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for this project
9. In the URL section, clicking the copy icon will copy the database URL to your clipboard
10. Leave this tab open, we will come back here later

<br/>

#### **Heroku**

1. Log into Heroku.com, click “New” and then “Create a new app”.
2. Choose a unique name for your app, select the region closest to you, and click “Create app”.
3. Go to the Settings tab of your new app
4. Click Reveal Config Vars
5. Return to your ElephantSQL tab and copy your database URL
6. Back on Heroku, add a Config Var called DATABASE_URL and paste your ElephantSQL database URL in as the value. Make sure you click “Add.”
7. Add each of your other environment variables except DEVELOPMENT and DB_URL from the env.py file as a Config Var. 
8. Navigate to the “Deploy” tab of your app.
9. select “Connect to GitHub” in the Deployment method section.
10. Search for your repo and click Connect
11. Optional: You can click Enable Automatic Deploys in case you make any further changes to the project. This will trigger any time code is pushed to your GitHub repository.
12. As we already have all our changes pushed to GitHub, we will use the Manual Deploy section and click Deploy Branch. This will start the build process. 
13. Now, we have our project in place, and we have an empty database ready for use. As you may remember from our local development, we still need to add our tables to our database. To do this, we can click the “More” button and select “Run console.”
14. Type python3 into the console and click Run
15. In the terminal that opens, write "from graevehart_import db" and then press enter.
16. In the terminal, write "db.create_all()" and then press enter.
17. Exit the Python terminal, by typing exit() and hitting enter, and close the console. Our Heroku database should now have the tables and columns created from our models.py file.
18. The app should be up and running now, so click the “Open app” button

<br/>

## **Testing**

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along. Both manual testing and validation was employed.  
There were several sticking points, connecting to Stripe functionality being one of them

I tested the page and had 3 people also manually test it on their own devices. For validation, I used the W3C validator, CSS validator, Python Linter and Lighthouse. 

<br/>

### **Validation**


#### **W3C Validator**

The [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. 

No HTML errors were found on the website.

<br/>

#### **CSS Validator**

The [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate the CSS.

No CSS errors were found on the website.

<br/>

#### **Pep8 Validator**

The [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to validate the Python code. From running the validator tool, a list was presented of errors within the code. 
The vast majority of the errors present were relating to the lines of code being over the character limit. These were simply solved through moving lines of code to the next
line down or the use of the \ to break a line where appropriate. Some lines contained very long URLs which are not recommended to be broke. These lines were simply suffixed
with the #noqa command which prevents them showing up in future linter validation scans.
Other errors included no blank lines at the bottom of the python files, these were simply corrected by adding a blank line.
Some 

#### **Lighthouse**

Lighthouse in Google Dev Tools was used to check performance, accessibility, best practices and search engine optimisation.

The Hart Botanics shop webpage scored high results throughout the website for accessibility, best practices and search engine optimisation. The only issue was with the performance, all image files were compressed to load quicker, however due to the
quality of the files and art being the main product on the page, I did not want to suffer quality issues. Therefore performance score is quite low on the pages containing large amount of image files. The loading speed does not suffer too much from this however.

### **Manual Testing**

To fully test my website, I used Google Chrome Developer Tools to ensure that the pages were responsive enough on all available screen sizes. Testing was performed on a variety of browsers (Microsoft Edge and Firefox) and devices (PC,Microsoft Surface, Nothing Phone 1, IPhone 12, Samsung S21 and OnePlus Phone).
The following tests were carried out by several people using several devices, each asked to complete all tasks listed.

### **Code Used**

* [Code Institute's 'Boutique Ado' walkthrough](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FSF_102+Q1_2020/courseware/4201818c00aa4ba3a0dae243725f6e32/d3188bf68530497aa5fba55d07a9d7d7/) was used as a template for this project - code taken from my own Boutique Ado "code-along" mini project and adapted where required to fit my user stories of my Hart Botanics Project.
